## Converting fonts

There is a font convert tool, fontconvert.c provided in the Adafruit GFX library, but it needs to be compiled into a working program first. The program basically converts a True Type Font (.ttf) file into a header file that is readable by the Adafruit GFX display library. Once you have compiled it, you will be able to run the program using the command line. The article on how to use the program can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/using-fonts#adding-new-fonts).
